AsciiDoc Themes

*AsciiDoc* is a (_mostly_ humane) text document format for writing short
documents, articles, books and man pages. Its toolchain is capable of
producing HTML4, XHTML, DocBook, man, and LaTeX. This page (link:index.txt[`index.txt`])
was originally written in _AsciiDoc_. `git(1)`'s manual pages and other documentation
are written in _AsciiDoc_.

_AsciiDoc_ generates basically good semantic markup, is styled with external
CSS, and includes support for themeing. The default theme included in AsciiDoc
is functional but is somewhat lacking in typographic consistencies; it is also
quite _blue_.

This package includes a variety of additional themes and a framework for
assembling them (see also: link:hacking.html[`HACKING`]).

[CAUTION]

This project was started on March 4, 2008 and is currently in the very early
stages of development. There's not many themes yet and not all themes style the
gambit of supported AsciiDoc markup. Also, I have not tested anything in any
version of Internet Explorer, yet.
