                   < http://tomayko.com/src/adoc-themes/ >

AsciiDoc is a (mostly humane) text document format for writing short
documents, articles, books and man pages. Its toolchain is capable of
producing HTML4, XHTML, DocBook, man, and LaTeX. Many projects use AsciiDoc,
including the Git content tracker.

AsciiDoc generates basically good semantic markup, is styled with external
CSS, and includes support for themeing. The default theme included in
AsciiDoc is functional but is somewhat lacking in typographic
consistencies; it is also quite blue.

This package includes a variety of additional themes and a framework for
assembling them. See the HACKING file included with this package for more
information.
