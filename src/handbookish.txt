Inspired by http://freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/[The FreeBSD Handbook],
one of The FreeBSD Documentation Project's many works of art, this theme is
probably most noticeable by its judicious use of _daemon red_ and its fatty
bold headings. FreeBSD's http://tinyurl.com/3afcwv[`sh(1)`] HTML manpage
provided the template for the manpage stylings.
