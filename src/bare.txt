The "bare" theme is meant as a starting point for other themes.  It includes a
basic level of structural and typographic styling but tries to remain
otherwise vanilla in its visual appearance. The manpage styles are based on the
default theme included with the http://bruji.com/bwana/[Bwana] manpage reader
for MacOS X.
